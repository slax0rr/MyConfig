Description
--------------

EditThisCookie is a cookie manager. You can add, delete, edit, search, protect and block cookies!
Inspired by the lack of a good cookie manager in google chrome i developed this small simple and extremely useful extension, that let's you perform anything you might actually need to do with cookies

* Delete any cookie
* Edit any cookie
* Add a new cookie
* Search a cookie
* Protect a cookie (read-only)
* Block cookies (cookie filter)
* Export cookies in JSON, Netscape cookie file (perfect for wget and curl), Perl::LPW
* Import cookies in JSON
* Limit the maximum expiration date of any cookie
