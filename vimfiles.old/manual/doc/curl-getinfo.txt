  * "http_code"
  * "header_size"
  * "request_size"
  * "filetime"
  * "ssl_verify_result"
  * "redirect_count"
  * "total_time"
  * "namelookup_time"

<?php >
    // Create a curl handle
    $ch = curl_init('http://www.yahoo.com/');

    // Execute
    curl_exec($ch);

    // Check if any error occurred
    if(!curl_errno($ch))
    {
     $info = curl_getinfo($ch);

     echo 'Took ' . $info['total_time'] . ' seconds to send a request to ' . $info

    Information gathered by this function is kept if the handle is re-used.
    This means that unless a statistic is overridden internally by this
    function, the previous info is returned.
