*Description*

*Parameters*

{mh}

{option}

    One of the CURLMOPT_* constants.

{value}

    The value to be set on {option}.

    {value} should be an int for the following values of the {option}
    parameter:

           Option                           Set {value} to
                         Pass 1 to enable or 0 to disable. Enabling pipelining
                         on a multi handle will make it attempt to perform
                         HTTP Pipelining as far as possible for transfers
                         using this handle. This means that if you add a
                         second request that can use an already existing
    CURLMOPT_PIPELINING  connection, the second request will be "piped" on the
                         same connection. As of cURL 7.43.0 you can also pass
                         2 to try to multiplex the new transfer over an
                         existing HTTP/2 connection if possible. Instead of
                         integer literals, you can also use the CURLPIPE_*
                         constants if available.
                         Pass a number that will be used as the maximum amount
                         of simultaneously open connections that libcurl may
    CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS cache. Default is 10. When the cache is full, curl
                         closes the oldest one in the cache to prevent the
                         number of open connections from increasing.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
