imagescale() scales an image using the given interpolation algorithm.

==============================================================================

    An image resource, returned by one of the image creation functions, such
    as |imagecreatetruecolor|.

    You should always provide the height if using PHP 5.5.18 or earlier, or
    PHP 5.6.2 or earlier, as the aspect ratio calculation was incorrect.

    IMG_BICUBIC_FIXED or anything else (will use two pass).
