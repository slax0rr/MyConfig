mb_substr â€” Get part of string

==============================================================================
*Description*

    string mb_substr ( string $str , int $start [, int $length = NULL [,~
    string $encoding = mb_internal_encoding() ]] )~

Performs a multi-byte safe |substr| operation based on number of characters.
Position is counted from the beginning of {str}. First character's position is
0. Second character position is 1, and so on.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{str}

    The string to extract the substring from.

{start}

    If {start} is non-negative, the returned string will start at the {start}
    'th position in {string}, counting from zero. For instance, in the string
    'abcdef', the character at position 0 is 'a', the character at position 2
    is 'c', and so forth.

    If {start} is negative, the returned string will start at the {start}'th
    character from the end of {string}.

{length}

    Maximum number of characters to use from {str}. If omitted or NULL is
    passed, extract all characters to the end of the string.

{encoding}

    The {encoding} parameter is the character encoding. If it is omitted, the
    internal character encoding value will be used.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

mb_substr() returns the portion of {str} specified by the {start} and {length}
parameters.
