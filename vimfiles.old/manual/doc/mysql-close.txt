mysql_close

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

mysql_close â€” Close MySQL connection

Warning

This extension was deprecated in PHP 5.5.0, and it was removed in PHP 7.0.0.
Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL extension should be used. See also MySQL:
choosing an API guide and related FAQ for more information. Alternatives to
this function include:

  * mysqli_close()
  * PDO: Assign the value of NULL to the PDO object

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool mysql_close ([ resource $link_identifier = NULL ] )~

mysql_close() closes the non-persistent connection to the MySQL server that's
associated with the specified link identifier. If {link_identifier} isn't
specified, the last opened link is used.

Open non-persistent MySQL connections and result sets are automatically
destroyed when a PHP script finishes its execution. So, while explicitly
closing open connections and freeing result sets is optional, doing so is
recommended. This will immediately return resources to PHP and MySQL, which
can improve performance. For related information, see freeing resources

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{ link_identifier}

    The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not specified, the last
    link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no connection is found or
    established, an E_WARNING level error is generated.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 mysql_close() example

<?php >
    $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
    if (!$link) {
        die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
    }
    echo 'Connected successfully';
    mysql_close($link);
<?>

The above example will output:

Connected successfully

==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    mysql_close() will not close persistent links created by |mysql_pconnect|.
    For additional details, see the manual page on persistent connections.
