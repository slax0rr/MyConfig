==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool mysql_drop_db ( string $database_name [, resource $link_identifier =~
    NULL ] )~

mysql_drop_db() attempts to drop (remove) an entire database from the server
associated with the specified link identifier. This function is deprecated, it
is preferable to use |mysql_query| to issue an sql DROP DATABASE statement
instead.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{database_name}

    The name of the database that will be deleted.

{ link_identifier}

    The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not specified, the last
    link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link is found, it
    will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no arguments.
    If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error is
    generated.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 mysql_drop_db() alternative example

<?php >
    $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
    if (!$link) {
        die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
    }

    $sql = 'DROP DATABASE my_db';
    if (mysql_query($sql, $link)) {
        echo "Database my_db was successfully dropped\n";
    } else {
        echo 'Error dropping database: ' . mysql_error() . "\n";
    }
<?>

Warning

This function will not be available if the MySQL extension was built against a
MySQL 4.x client library.
