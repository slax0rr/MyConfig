apcu_entry

(PECL apcu >= 5.1.0)

apcu_entry â€” Atomically fetch or generate a cache entry

==============================================================================
*Description*

    mixed apcu_entry ( string $key , callable $generator [, int $ttl = 0 ] )~

Atomically attempts to find {key} in the cache, if it cannot be found
{generator} is called, passing {key} as the only argument. The return value of
the call is then cached with the optionally specified {ttl}, and returned.

    Note: When control enters apcu_entry() the lock for the cache is acquired
    exclusively, it is released when control leaves apcu_entry(): In effect,
    this turns the body of {generator} into a critical section, disallowing
    two processes from executing the same code paths concurrently. In
    addition, it prohibits the concurrent execution of any other APCu
    functions, since they will acquire the same lock.

Warning

The only APCu function that can be called safely by {generator} is apcu_entry
().

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{key}

    Identity of cache entry

{generator}

    A callable that accepts {key} as the only argument and returns the value
    to cache.

{ttl}

    Time To Live; store {var} in the cache for {ttl} seconds. After the {ttl}
    has passed, the stored variable will be expunged from the cache (on the
    next request). If no {ttl} is supplied (or if the {ttl} is 0), the value
    will persist until it is removed from the cache manually, or otherwise
    fails to exist in the cache (clear, restart, etc.).

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the cached value

*Examples*

Example #1 An apcu_entry() example

<?php >
    $config = apcu_entry("config", function($key) {
     return [
       "fruit" => apcu_entry("config.fruit", function($key){
         return [
           "apples",
           "pears"
         ];
       }), 
       "people" => apcu_entry("config.people", function($key){
         return [
          "bob",
          "joe",
          "niki"
         ];
       })
     ];
    });

    var_dump($config);
<?>

The above example will output:

array(2) {
  ["fruit"]=>
  array(2) {
    [0]=>
    string(6) "apples"
    [1]=>
    string(5) "pears"
  }
  ["people"]=>
  array(3) {
    [0]=>
    string(3) "bob"
    [1]=>
    string(3) "joe"
    [2]=>
    string(4) "niki"
  }
}
