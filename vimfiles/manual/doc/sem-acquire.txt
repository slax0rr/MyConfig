sem_acquire

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

sem_acquire â€” Acquire a semaphore

==============================================================================
*Description*

    bool sem_acquire ( resource $sem_identifier [, bool $nowait = false ] )~

sem_acquire() by default blocks (if necessary) until the semaphore can be
acquired. A process attempting to acquire a semaphore which it has already
acquired will block forever if acquiring the semaphore would cause its maximum
number of semaphore to be exceeded.

After processing a request, any semaphores acquired by the process but not
explicitly released will be released automatically and a warning will be
generated.

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{sem_identifier}

    {sem_identifier} is a semaphore resource, obtained from |sem_get|.

{nowait}

    Specifies if the process shouldn't wait for the semaphore to be acquired.
    If set to true, the call will return false immediately if a semaphore
    cannot be immediately acquired.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

==============================================================================
*Changelog*
