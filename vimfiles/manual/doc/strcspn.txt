strcspn

(PHP 4, PHP 5)

strcspn â€” Find length of initial segment not matching mask

==============================================================================
*Description*

    int strcspn ( string $subject , string $mask [, int $start [, int $length~
    ]] )~

Returns the length of the initial segment of {subject} which does not contain
any of the characters in {mask}.

If {start} and {length} are omitted, then all of {subject} will be examined.
If they are included, then the effect will be the same as calling strcspn
(substr($subject, $start, $length), $mask) (see |substr| for more
information).

==============================================================================
*Parameters*

{subject}

    The string to examine.

{mask}

    The string containing every disallowed character.

{start}

    The position in {subject} to start searching.

    If {start} is given and is non-negative, then strcspn() will begin
    examining {subject} at the {start}'th position. For instance, in the
    string 'abcdef', the character at position 0 is 'a', the character at
    position 2 is 'c', and so forth.

    If {start} is given and is negative, then strcspn() will begin examining
    {subject} at the {start}'th position from the end of {subject}.

{length}

    The length of the segment from {subject} to examine.

    If {length} is given and is non-negative, then {subject} will be examined
    for {length} characters after the starting position.

    If {length} is given and is negative, then {subject} will be examined from
    the starting position up to {length} characters from the end of {subject}.

==============================================================================
*Return* *Values*

Returns the length of the initial segment of {subject} which consists entirely
of characters not in {mask}.

    Note:

    When a {start} parameter is set, the returned length is counted starting
    from this position, not from the beginning of {subject}.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 strcspn() example

<?php >
    $a = strcspn('abcd',  'apple');
    $b = strcspn('abcd',  'banana');
    $c = strcspn('hello', 'l');
    $d = strcspn('hello', 'world');
    $e = strcspn('abcdhelloabcd', 'abcd', -9);
    $f = strcspn('abcdhelloabcd', 'abcd', -9, -5);

    var_dump($a);
    var_dump($b);
    var_dump($c);
    var_dump($d);
    var_dump($e);
    var_dump($f);
<?>

The above example will output:

int(0)
int(0)
int(2)
int(2)
int(5)
int(4)
